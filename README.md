# Linear Actuator Project

## Overview 
3d modeled and printed linear actuator, all stl files are included and links to parts. Printed with PLA I will eventually make useing PETG when everything is working together.

## Next Steps
Project will include details with motor, h-bridge, and C code for usable functions. Maybe use a stepper motor.
